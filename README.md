# Language Evolution

## An agent-based simulation of language evolution.

Language Evolution is a simulation game that tries to reproduce and explain the natural language evolution 
that happened among humans many thousand years ago. Modeled as an agent-based system, it uses independent
individual agents that behave differently according to a set of rules built in each one.

With a given independent behavior, the agents give names to their surrounding objects creating this way a
personal dictionary, then share it with other agents until they reach an agreement on the community vocabulary.
Thus evolved languages are bond to barbarian invasions, foreigner influences and random neologism generation,
all common events shared by the major part of the ancient civilizations.

Please read the [wiki](https://github.com/landart/LanguageEvolution/wiki) for more information about the game mechanics.
